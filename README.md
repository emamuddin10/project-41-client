5 Key Features of my Blog Website:

* Category & Title-Based Blog Filtering
Users can easily search and filter blogs based on category and blog title for a better browsing experience.

* User Wishlist System
Logged-in users can add blogs to their personal wishlist and view them later on a dedicated wishlist page.

* Blog Comment Section
Each blog details page includes a comment section where users can leave comments (except on their own blogs), and all comments show the commenter’s name and profile picture.

* Featured Blogs Table
A table displays the top 10 featured blogs based on the word count of each blog's long description.

* Newsletter Subscription with Toast Notification
When users submit their email, a toast message confirms their subscription to the newsletter—no actual email sending needed.
